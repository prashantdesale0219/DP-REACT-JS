            The format has appeared most often in four major versions: the main MasterChef series, MasterChef: The Professionals for professional working chefs, Celebrity MasterChef featuring celebrities as the contestants, and Junior MasterChef, a version created and adapted for children, which was first developed in 1994 and has also expanded to other countries in recent years.
            Despite the four major versions, in 2012, Australia created the fifth version called MasterChef All-Stars, for former contestants to raise money for charity.[4] In 2018, Ukraine created MasterChef Teens, for teenage contestants. In 2019, Brazil created MasterChef: Para Tudo (MasterChef: Stop Everything), a TV show featuring interviews with judges and former contestants, plus recipes and memes, presented by Ana Paula Padr√£o.[5] In Brazil, MasterChef All-Stars was titled MasterChef: A Revanche (MasterChef: The Rematch), being released in 2019 and featuring former contestants who did not win the competition before.[6] In 2022, Brazil created MasterChef +, for seniors over 60 years old contestants. </p>
